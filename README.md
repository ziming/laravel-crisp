Just a simple wrapper for crisp php library for now. More documentation will be added later.

## Support us

To be added later

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require ziming/laravel-crisp
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="crisp-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'website_id' => env('CRISP_WEBSITE_ID'),
    'tier' => env('CRISP_TIER', 'plugin'),
    'access_key_id' => env('CRISP_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    'secret_access_key' => env('CRISP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
];
```

## Usage

So what are the differences between the Crisp's official PHP SDK and this package?

The 1st main difference is that you don't have to set the tier & api credentials every time after instantiating

You also do not have to pass in the `website_id` every time.

I hope through the examples below, you can see how much more convenient this brings for those of us who only have a single
Crisp workspace.


```php
// Official PHP Crisp SDK
use Crisp\CrispClient;
$officialCrisp = new CrispClient();
$officialCrisp->setTier('plugin');
$officialCrisp->authenticate(config('crisp.access_key_id'), config('crisp.secret_access_key'));
$officialCrisp->websitePeople->findByEmail(config('crisp.website_id'), 'abc@example.com');

// This package
$laravelCrisp = new Ziming\LaravelCrisp();
$laravelCrisp->websitePeople->findByEmail('abc@example.com');

// If you prefer the laravel facade approach you can just do this
\Ziming\LaravelCrisp\Facades\LaravelCrisp::websitePeople()->findByEmail('abc@example.com');

// If for some reason you want to use a different website_id, the official Crisp client is always available too
$laravelCrisp->officialClient->websitePeople->findByEmail(
    config('crisp.website_id'), 
    'abc@example.com'
);
```

The second main difference are extra methods that I think are useful but are not in Crisp official SDK when I 1st
added them. For now it is just these 3.

```php
// Gives you the Crisp Profile Link in Crisp
\Ziming\LaravelCrisp\Resources\WebsitePeople::getProfileLink('people-id');

// Get the first people id that matches the search text if 1 or more results are returned
$laravelCrisp = new Ziming\LaravelCrisp();
$laravelCrisp->websitePeople->getFirstPeopleIdBySearchText('abc@example.com');

// Gives you the conversation link in Crisp
\Ziming\LaravelCrisp\Resources\WebsiteConversations::getConversationLink('session-id');

```

## Testing
